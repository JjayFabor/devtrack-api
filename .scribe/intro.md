# DevTrack API – Developer Productivity Platform

Welcome to the DevTrack API documentation.

This documentation aims to provide all the information you need to work with our API.

- Manage tasks, log learning sessions, track progress on side projects, and store programming-related notes or bugs encountered—all in a centralized and versioned API.
- As you scroll, you'll see code examples for working with the API in bash (for now) in the dark area to the right.

**Happy coding!**
